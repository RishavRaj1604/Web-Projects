    <h2> Report: Large Coursework </h2>
    <h3> Name: Janvi Saluja </h3>
    <br>
    <h4> INTRODUCTION: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> I choose to make a magazine on Fashion and named it "Sugar Fashion". </li>
      <li> It is greatly influenced by Vogue magazine, Louis Vuitton and Chanel products. </li>
      <li> I decided to go for the hierarchical model. </li>
      <li> Even though I decided to go for the hierarchical model my Home page does have few links connecting to other pages. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> INSPIRATION: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> I closely follow latest fashion trends and like to talk about it with people around me. So, I decided to go for a fashion magazine. </li>
      <li> I find myself very invloved in Korean Culture. I closely follow K-Pop Idols and their fashion and dressing sense. I decided to add that personal touch in my project.</li>
      <li> I wanted to make different layouts for each article and tried my best to not repeat the same pattern. I went through a lot of free sample templates present on Google to find the perfect layout for my project.></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4> ACCESSIBILTY: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Instead of using different colors I decided to go for the classic black and white color to make it easy to read and understand. I used brick red color in few occassions as a background color for the images to make the image pop out. </li>
      <li> I tried to use less words as much as possible and tried not to use any words to make it harder for someone to understand. I used proper names for links so the user knows which link with led them to which page. </li>
      <li> I added a lot of animations in my project and made sure that they are smooth and have an accurate timing and doesnot look rushed as it trigger sickness motion in some people. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> USABILITY: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> The project is accessible in both desktop version and the mobile version. The page is best viewed in 1994 x 835 dimensions for the desktop vesion and 360 x 740 dimensions for the mobile version with 75% zoomed in.</li>
      <li> The content on the website is relevant. It has been designed to provide the users with all the information they are searching for and decided to ue the website. </li>
      <li> I tried to keep the content that is familiar with the users and tried not to use any information that might be misleading or I am not sure about it and doesnot have a good source t back it up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> LEARNING PROCESS: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> I learnt how to make several animations in the website. </li>
      <li> I learnt how to use Javascript to control the video playing. </li>
      <li> The most importnat thing I learnt was how to make website responsive. For my mid term project I found it very hard to make a page responsive but I feel I am more comfortable with it now. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> STRONG POINTS: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> I feel that the content in my project is very relevant. I can back it up with good resources and know that the information is always true in all situations. I used images of a lot of well-known people to attract more audience and people check the website to
      get an update on them to increase my viewers. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> IMPROVEMENTS: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> In the future I would like to add a dark and light mode I did try to add it but it did not looked very consistent. Moreover, I would like to add a User account so people can like and save the posts and pictures they like. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> RESOURCES: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Sitemap was made using free desktop version of Creately. </li>
      <li> The logo and favicon are made using free version of Canva. </li>
      <li> The code editor used was Atom. </li>
      <li> The images were taken from all the open sources like Google, Pexels, etc. </li>
      <li> The information has been taken from Louis Vuitton, The Vogue magazine and Chanel website. </li>
